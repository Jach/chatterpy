This project is licensed under the GNU Affero GPL version 3 or greater. What
this means is that you will need to include a link to your source code
to any web users, not just people you distribute the code to. (A link to this
repository is satisfactory unless you make big changes, the link will be in 
the about page.) If you find this to be too much of an inconvenience or a
deal-breaker, contact me and I'd be happy to grant you an MIT License exception.
If enough people make a request I'll probably just rerelease under the MIT.
I just like the GPL for larger projects. Obviously consider (and I claim)
config.py and schema.sql to be in the public domain, and any third party
libraries to be covered by their respective licenses.
